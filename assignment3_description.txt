Anakaren Salinas worked on creating the novel visualization processing file, which consists of as many 
random words from uniquewords as possible (while still being legible and having margins) being drawn on 
the screen. The colors are inspired by the gothic colors of dracula, and consist of a bright blood red,
a more neutral dark maroon, and a light cream (inspired by very pale vampire skin) on a black background.
In order to make the blood red stand out and have more contrast, only the words with less than 5 letters
were filled with red, with the more neutral colors making up the rest of the longer words. The font chosen,
Trattatello (.ttf included in a3_novelvisualization) is a font that looks old fashioned and a bit gothic,
fitting the Dracula theme. In order to add the words, while the y location of the words is less than the
height minus some padding amount, it is determined if the word fits within the width, and it it doesn't a 
new line is made and it is added there.
